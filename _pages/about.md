# Hi there! I'm Sahar

I'm an **AI researcher & engineer**  **Entrepreneur** and a **Father**.

## AI

I'm working as an AI tech lead at [Axon-pulse](https://axon-pulse.com/), building AI solutions to radars in the automotive and defence field.

I love to solve problems using deep learning, I find this problem solving method elegant and robust. 

I'm also in love with open source. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/SaharCarmel) to see my projects and get in touch!

## Entrepreneur

I'm an entrepreneur by heart, built couple of companies built to solve problems, so far none of them succeeded. If you have an interesting idea, contact me and let's talk. 

## Father

I have a little girl named Dror that gives me the reason to wake up (Along my beloved wife Nofar). 
Being a parent gives me a better perspective on the important things in life.


I work at Tel-Aviv and loves to meet new people. Drop me a message if you're around. I'll be more than happy to offer you an Espresso ☕️!
