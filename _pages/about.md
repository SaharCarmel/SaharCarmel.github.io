# Hi there! I'm Sahar

I'm an **AI researcher & engineer**, **Entrepreneur** and a **Father**.

## AI

I'm working as an AI tech lead at [Axon-pulse](https://axon-pulse.com/), building AI solutions to radars in the automotive and defence field.

I love to solve problems using deep learning, I find this problem solving method elegant and robust. 

I'm also in love with open source. Checkout my [<i class="fab fa-github"></i>  Github profile](https://github.com/SaharCarmel) to see my projects and get in touch!

## Entrepreneur

I'm an entrepreneur by heart, built couple of companies, my last one was [MonstersAcademy](https://monstersacademy.tech) where we have developed a revolutionary product that trains and implements smart human like bots to games.I'm actively looking for new adventures, so if you have an interesting idea, contact me and let's talk. 

## Father

I have a little girl named Dror that gives me the reason to wake up (Along my beloved wife Nofar). 
I gain a better appreciation of life's important things after becoming a parent.


I work at Tel-Aviv and loves to meet new people. Drop me a message if you're around. I'll be more than happy to offer you an Espresso ☕️!
